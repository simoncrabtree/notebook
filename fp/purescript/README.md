# Purescript

Problem: learning purescript is a bit daunting - can we jump straight to making something work which works better (and ideally looks better) than the equivalent JS code

Goal: write a small app which does something useful, like calling an http api and parsing the result

* To call an API we need to make an async call (an effect). Think I need to use Aff?

* What is Aff, how do I use it?
